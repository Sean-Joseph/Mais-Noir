# Mais-Noir
At the intersection of technology and expressions of social critique, Potluck Design & Development presents mais noir

Mais Noir is a filter that takes the ostensibly objective SERP (search engine results pages) we, digital citizens, are all too familiar with and reconociles it with an interpretation of anti-blackness that is real, not theoretical. 

## How to run app
1. Either fork or download the app and open the folder in the CLI
2. You will then need to go to GIPHY and Unsplash and upload you own API keys where it says API_KEYS
3. Install all dependencies using the `npm i` command
4. Start the web server using npm run start. The app will be served on http://localhost:3000/

## User Stories
- A user can search terms in the search bar (note queries should be something like 'boy' 'girls' 'beautiful women', etc.)
- A user can go back and type in a new search query

## Future  Features
- Add in more search queries
- Add in more options to search besides just gifs and images

## Dependencies
  - React
  - React DOM

## What the App Looks like
